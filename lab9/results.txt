Discussion:
As one would expect, the smaller the file size, the faster the program is able to go through it.
There is also a direct correlation with the buffer size.  When a larger buffer size is provided, on average the program is able to read through the file faster.
Finally, when having to run multiple threads, the more threads that it has to run the longer the program takes to finish.
As a note: for the mass testing I removed the testing on file5.txt as my computer has less then 9GB of free space.

a)
100000 file1.txt
1000000 file2.txt
10000000 file3.txt
100000000 file4.txt
10000000000 file5.txt

b)

d)
file5.txt is too big to duplicate so I am using file4.txt
Original file size: 100000000 file4.txt

time ./step4 file4.txt 100

Original file size = Copy 1 file size = Copy 2 file size
