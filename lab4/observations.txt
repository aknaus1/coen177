Part 1:
    No we do not get the same result each time that we run the program.  This is because the local variables are shared between all of the threads.

    The parameter arg is a per-thread variable and is stored in the stack in memory allocated for the go function.

    The local variable i is a shared state variable.  It is stored within the main() function.

Part 2:
    The main thread can now be completed before each of the child threads.

Part 3:
    Global Defined Number of threads:
        #define NTHREADS 2

    Global Defined Size of Each Matrix:
        #define N 2
        #define M 3
        #define L 3
    
    Global Defined Matrices:
        int matrixA[N][M], matrixB[M][L], matrixC[N][L];

    Local Variable i stored in Struct:
