Step 1: Start by setting up VMware
    In commannd line: 
        $ setup vmware
            This command prepares vmware to run
        $ minix-get-image (can tab complete)
            Please note that this will COMPLETELY ERASE any old image. Only need to do this once
        $ vmware &
            This may take a little while to boot up, so be patient.
            If you don't see the “minix” option on the left, go to: • Open a Virtual Machine -> “vm images” subfolder -> “minix3” subfolder -> minix3.vmx
Step 2: Logging In
    The username for the minix system is “root” (with no password, at least until you set one). 
    Type "passwd" to set your own password.
Step 3: FTP Access
    In the minix system type:
        "tcpd ftp /usr/bin/in.ftpd &"
            enables ftp Access
        “ifconfig"
            Displays IP address
    On the Host Machine open a terminal and type:
        "ftp <the IP address you got from ifconfig>"
            this will connect you to the "minix" Machine
        In case you are unfamiliar with FTP commands: 
            For Remote Navigation 
                ls - show contents of remote directory 
                pwd - show current location in VM 
                cd - change directory on the VM 
            For Local Navigation 
                lcd - show current location on host machine 
                lcd <directory> - change location to <directory> 
            File Transfer 
                get <file> - copy <file> from current location in VM to current location on host. 
                put <file> - copy <file> from current location on host to current location in VM. 
Step 4: Modify kernel:
    You will find the kernel files inside the "/usr/src" directory
    To search for lines inside a file you may use grep utility
    Once you have modified the kernel type "make world" to recompile minix
    Then reboot the system by typing "reboot"
